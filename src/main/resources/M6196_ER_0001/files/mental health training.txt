Mental Health Services

The Mental Health Association will coordinate training sessions for mental health professionals in New York City and these sessions will begin in the first week of November. We are working closelyw with the City and State offices of mental health to coordinate efforts, avoid duplication of training and maximize the use of available training dollars which they have at their disposal. Cicatelli Associates, a non-profit training organization with 25 years of experience working with early childhood service providers, is developing training for the staff of childcare centers in the tristate area.
